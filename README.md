# Harbor Scanner Adapter for Trivy

The Harbor [Scanner Adapter][harbor-pluggable-scanners] for [Trivy] is a service that translates the [Harbor] scanning
API into Trivy commands and allows Harbor to use Trivy for providing vulnerability reports on images stored in Harbor
registry as part of its vulnerability scan feature.

Harbor Scanner Adapter for Trivy is the default static vulnerability scanner in Harbor >= 2.2.

![Vulnerabilities](docs/images/vulnerabilities.png)

For compliance with core components Harbor builds the adapter service binaries into Docker images based on Photos OS
(`goharbor/trivy-adapter-photon`), whereas in this repository we build Docker images based on Alpine
(`aquasec/harbor-scanner-trivy`). There is no difference in functionality though.

## Deployment

In Harbor >= 2.0 Trivy can be configured as the default vulnerability scanner, therefore you can install it with the
official [Harbor Helm chart], where `HARBOR_CHART_VERSION` >= 1.4:

```
helm repo add harbor https://helm.goharbor.io
```

```
helm install harbor harbor/harbor \
  --create-namespace \
  --namespace harbor
```

The adapter service is automatically registered under the **Interrogation Service** in the Harbor interface and
designated as the default scanner.

## Configuration

Configuration of the adapter is done via environment variables at startup.

- [Releases](./docs/RELEASES.md) - how to release a new version of harbor-scanner-trivy.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: database error: --skip-db-update cannot be specified on the first run

If you set the value of the `SCANNER_TRIVY_SKIP_UPDATE` to `true`, make sure that you download the [Trivy DB]
and mount it in the `/home/scanner/.cache/trivy/db/trivy.db` path.

### Error: failed to list releases: Get <https://api.github.com/repos/aquasecurity/trivy-db/releases>: dial tcp: lookup api.github.com on 127.0.0.11:53: read udp 127.0.0.1:39070->127.0.0.11:53: i/o timeout

Most likely it's a Docker DNS server or network firewall configuration issue. Trivy requires internet connection to
periodically download vulnerability database from GitHub to show up-to-date risks.

Try adding a DNS server to `docker-compose.yml` created by Harbor installer.

```yaml
version: 2
services:
  trivy-adapter:
    # NOTE Adjust IPs to your environment.
    dns:
      - 8.8.8.8
      - 192.168.1.1
```

Alternatively, configure Docker daemon to use the same DNS server as host operating system. See [DNS services][docker-dns]
section in the Docker container networking documentation for more details.

### Error: failed to list releases: GET <https://api.github.com/repos/aquasecurity/trivy-db/releases>: 403 API rate limit exceeded

Trivy DB downloads from GitHub are subject to [rate limiting][gh-rate-limit]. Make sure that the Trivy DB is mounted
and cached in the `/home/scanner/.cache/trivy/db/trivy.db` path. If, for any reason, it's not enough you can set the
value of the `SCANNER_TRIVY_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable (authenticated requests get a higher rate limit).
